  "body": "# SEO Umbraco Extension\r\nUmbraco extension to quickly create SEO friendly websites. The package includes a partial document type \r\nto add SEO elements to existing or new documents. It also comes with some child actions in order to \r\nrender the SEO elements to site layout.\r\n\r\nAll of the following properties are available in the `SEO` document type located in the `Partials` folder. \r\nAdd the `SEO` document type as a composition to any document types which will add the SEO properties to the content.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n`Install-Package MarcelDigital.UmbracoExtensions.SEO`\r\n\r\n## Title\r\nThis property controls the output of the title for the content which will be rendered into the title tag. Title tags \r\nare used by search engines and are important for social sharing. Normally, the title of the content is the \r\nsame as the name of the content in Umbraco, but sometimes this needs to be overridden. Use this property along \r\nwith the `SeoTitle()` method on the `Umbraco` helper to output the title tag body.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n<title>@Umbraco.SeoTitle() | [Your Site Name]</title>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen there is no value in the `Title` property, then the name of the content is used in it's place.\r\n\r\n## Meta Description\r\nThis property allows a description to be added to the content that provides a concise explanation of the contents. \r\nSearch engines will use this to display preview snippets for your content in search results. Use this property \r\nalong with the `MetaDescriptionTag` method on the `Umbraco` helper to render the meta description \r\nto the layout.\r\n```csharp\r\n<head>\r\n    ...\r\n    @Umbraco.MetaDescriptionTag()\r\n    ...\r\n</head>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there is no value in the `Meta Description` property, then no meta tag is rendered to the page. Otherwise\r\nthe meta tag with the description entered is added to the page.\r\n```html\r\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"[Your Description Here]\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add a default meta description when there is none avaliable, pass the default text into the helper and it will be \r\nbe used when the content has no value entered into the meta description property\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n<head>\r\n    ...\r\n    @Umbraco.MetaDescriptionTag(\"[Default meta description]\")\r\n    ...\r\n</head>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Canonical Url\r\nThis property allows overriding the canonical url for the content. A canonical tag gives credit to a \r\nspecific URL as the sole source of a piece of content or information. The property `Canonical Override` \r\nallows you to specify a different canonical url for the content in place of the url generated by Umbraco. \r\nUse this property along with the `CanonicalTag` method on the `Umbraco` helper to render \r\nthe canonical tag to the layout.\r\n```csharp\r\n<head>\r\n    ...\r\n    @Umbraco.CanonicalTag()\r\n    ...\r\n</head>\r\n```\r\nWhen there is no value for the `Canonical Override` property, the default Umbraco generated url will\r\nbe used instead. The following tag will be rendered to the page.\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://exmaple.com/path/to/contnet/\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n## No Index / No Follow\r\nThese properties allow for setting the index and follow robots meta tag for your content. Setting content to \"no index\" will tell\r\nthe crawler to ignore the content from its indexing, while setting \"no follow\" will inform the crawler to not pass link equity \r\nthrough any of the links in the content. Use these properties along with the `RobotsTag` method on the `Umbraco` helper to render\r\nthe robots meta tag to the layout.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n<head>\r\n    ...\r\n    @Umbraco.RobotsTag()\r\n    ...\r\n</head>\r\n```\r\nThe following tag will be rendered to the page.\r\n```html\r\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"[no]index, [no]follow\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Hide from Xml Sitemap\r\nThis property is to be used in conjunction with creation of an XML sitemap for the Umbraco instance.\r\nIf you do not already have a way to create an XML sitemap, see Marcel Digital's package for this \r\n[here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MarcelDigital.UmbracoExtensions.XmlSitemap/). Setting this property\r\nto true should tell the XML sitemap generator to omit this content from the sitemap.",
